I worked on this as an assignemt during the selection process.

Technologies used: PHP, JS, HTML, CSS

I had a problem with JS validation. If a person enters wrong/incomplete data the form doesn't get submitted, but once they correct it the form won't submit again. This part I need to resolve.

Some code refactoring is also needed.
